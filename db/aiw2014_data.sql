As dogs were available as cuts of meat, they were also available live, right next to the live pigs, chickens, and other livestock.

The potent moonshine is decanted by vendors from large white plastic jugs to used bottled water containers. If you doubt the ability of a vendor\'s hooch to peel paint or light your senses on fire, you can try a shot for free.\r\n<p>At the fair, adventurous gastronomes can try “thang co” blood porridge, a popular dish of the H’Mong and other local people.

It lies between a half – mountain half – plain with an area of \r\n\r\nnearly 150,000 square metres. A new Bai Dinh Pagoda was built next to the old one facing southeast. \r\n\r\nThis pagoda covers an area of 700ha, located on Ba Rau hills, near Hoang Long river. This is a large \r\n\r\ncomplex which includes many items built in several different stages. Big, bold and solemn structures, \r\n\r\ndeeply imbued with Vietnamese architecture, Bai Dinh Pagoda complex was arranged in five layers \r\n\r\nupward, including a temple’s inner Three Entrance Gate, a bell tower, a temple dedicated to Bodhisattva \r\n\r\nAvalokitesvara, Phap Chu Temple devoted to the Shakyamuni Buddha, and Tam The Temple dedicated \r\n\r\nto Buddha.</br>\r\n\r\nThree Entrance Gate, which features a three-layer curved roof, covered with glazed dark brown tiles \r\n\r\nproduced in Bat Trang pottery village. Inside, the Three Entrance Gate houses two statues of Lokapalas \r\n\r\n(Ho Phap), which is 5m high and weights 12 tonnes each, and it is supported by four wooden pillars, \r\n\r\nwhich is 13.85m high and 0.85m in diameter each.</br>\r\n\r\nFive hundred Arhat statues, made of greenstone, are placed along the two sides of corridors leading up \r\n\r\nto other structures of the pagoda complex. Each statue, from 2 to 2.5m in height, 2 to 2.5 tonnes in \r\n\r\nweight, renders unique facial expression and posture that is not expressed by the other.\r\n\r\nThe Three Entrance Gate is followed by the bell tower, built in the octagonal shape with three-layer \r\n\r\ncurved roof. It houses a bronze bell weighing 36 tonnes.</br>\r\n\r\nThe temple dedicated to Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara is a seven-compartment single-roofed building where \r\n\r\nthe 90-tonne bronze statue of Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara with many eyes and hands is placed.\r\n\r\nThe Phap Chu temple devoted to the Shakyamuni Buddha has two-layer curved roof. It is 30m high, \r\n\r\n47.6m long, and 43.3m wide. Inside the temple sits the 100-tonne statue of Shakyamuni Buddha.

The repeated regression and transgression of the sea on the limestone karst over geological time has produced a mature landscape of clusters of conical peaks and isolated towers which were modified by sea invasion, adding an extra element to the process of lateral undercutting of the limestone towers and islands.</p>\r\n<p>Comprised of a multitude of limestone islands and islets rising from the sea, in a variety of sizes and shapes and presenting picturesque, unspoiled nature, Ha Long Bay is a spectacular seascape sculpted by nature. The property retains a high level of naturalness, and despite its long history of human use, is not seriously degraded. Outstanding features of the property include the magnificent towering limestone pillars and associated notches, arches and caves, which are exceptionally well-developed and among the best presented of their type in the world.</p>\r\n<p>Criterion (viii): As the most extensive and best known example of marine-invaded tower karst in the world Ha Long Bay is one of the world&rsquo;s most important areas of Fengcong&nbsp;(clusters of conical peaks) and Fenglin (isolated tower features) karst. Abundant lakes, occupying drowned dolines, are one of the distinctive features of the Fencong karst, with some appearing to be tidal. Possessing a tremendous diversity of caves and other landforms derived from the unusual geomorphological process of marine invaded tower karst the caves are of three main types: remnants of phreatic caves; old karstic foot caves and marine notch caves. The property also displays the full range of karst formation processes on a very large scale and over a very long period of geological time, possessing the most complete and extensive exzample of its type in the world and providing a unique and extensive reservoir of data for the future understanding of geoclimatic history and the nature of karst processes in a complex environment.</p>\r\n<p>All elements necessary to sufficiently protect the outstanding scenic and geological values of the Ha Long Bay property are included within the boundaries of the property and its size and area provide sufficient integrity for the large-scale geomorphological processes to operate unhindered. It benefits from being completely surrounded by a large and extensive buffer zone with both the size and area providing sufficient integrity for the large-scale geomorphic processes to operate unhindered.</p>\r\n<p>Located within an area of high tourism, marine transport, fisheries and the daily activities of people living and conducting their business on Ha Long Bay, management of the area, instituted since inscription of the property, applies strict regulation and control of activities in&nbsp;an attempt to minimize impacts on the integrity of the property. There is a continuing challenge to improve the integrity and quality of the environment. The natural scenic features, geomorphology, landform values and cultural heritage along with key features such as islands, caves and grottoes remain intact and the property retains a high level of naturalness despite the long history of human use in the area.</p>','Long Nguyen','2014-12-28 20:57:48','2014-12-28 20:57:48',1,'Halong-bay-Vietnamt.jpg','ha_long_bay-thumb.jpg','Tourism, marine transport, fisheries'),(7,'Hon Khoai Island','<p><em>Hon Khoai, the biggest of a group of islets, is a rocky island of hills and forests including various kinds of precious wood like the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; wood.&nbsp;The wild natural landscapes attract a great deal of tourists...</em></p>\r\n<p>Hon Khoai Island lies off the southern tip of the&nbsp;Mekong Delta&nbsp;and is&nbsp;is one of the well-known landscapes of the southernmost province of&nbsp;Ca Mau, about 15kilometres from the mainland.</p>\r\n<p>Formerly, Hon Khoai was called Giang Huong, Independence Island and Poulo Obi in the French domination.

My Son site is a group of temple-towers of Cham people, an imperial city during the Champa kingdom, an example displaying the evolution and change in culture, a foremost evidence of Asian civilisation which is now extinct. With its great value, in December 1999, the complex of My Son Cham Towers has been recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.</p>\r\n<p>My Son Sanctuary is a large complex of religious relics that comprises more than 70 architectural works. They include temples and towers that connect to each other with complicated red brick designs. The main component of the Cham architectural design is the tower, built to reflect the divinity of the king.</p>\r\n<p>According to records on the stone stele, the prime foundation of the ancient My Son architectural complex was a wooden temple to worship the Siva Bhadresvera genie. In the late 16th century, a big fire destroyed the temple. Step by step, historical mysteries were unveiled by scientists.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>\r\n<p>Through stone stele and royal dynasties, they proved My Son to be the most important Holy Land of the Cham people from the late 4th to the 15th centuries. For many centuries, the Cham built Lip, a mutually linked architectural complex, with baked bricks and sandstone. The main temple worships the Linga-Yoni, who represents the capability of invention. Beside the main tower (Kalan) are several sub-towers worshipping Genies or deceased kings. Although time and the wars have destroyed some towers, the remaining sculptural and architectural remnants still reflect the style and history of the art of the Cham people. Their masterpieces mark a glorious time for the architecture and culture of the Cham, as well as of Southeast Asia.</p>\r\n<p>Each historical period has its own identity, so that each temple worshipping a genie or a king of a different dynasty has its own architectural style full of different impression. All of the Cham towers were built on a quadrate foundations and each comprises three parts: a solid tower base, representing the world of human beings, the mysterious and sacred tower body, representing the world of spirits, and the tower top built in the shape of a man offering flowers and fruits or of trees, birds, animals, etc., representing things that are close to the spirits and human beings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ARCHITECTURE</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to many researchers of the ancient Cham towers, the architectural art of the Cham towers at My Son Sanctuary is the convergence of different styles, including the continuity of the ancient style in the 7th-8th centuries, the Hoa Lai style of the 8th-9th centuries, the Dong Duong style from the mid-9th century, the My Son and My Son-Binh Dinh styles, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Among the remnants of many architectural sites excavated in 1898, a 24 metres high tower was found in the Thap Chua area and coded A I by archaeologists and researchers on My Son. This tower is a masterpiece of ancient Cham architecture. It has two doors, one in the east and the other in the west. The tower body is high and delicate with a system of paved pillars; six sub-towers surround the tower. This two storey tower looks like a lotus flower. The top of the upper layer is made of sandstone and carved with elephant and I ion designs. In the lower layer, the walls are carved with fairies and water evils and men riding elephants. Unfortunately, the tower was destroyed by US bombs in 1969.</p>\r\n<p>After the My Son ancient tower complex was discovered, many of its artifacts, especially statues of female dancers and genies worshipped by the Cham people, worship animals and artifacts of the daily communal activities, were collected and displayed at the Cham Architecture Museum in Danang city. Although there are not many remnants left, those that remain display the typical sculptural works of cultural value of the Cham nationality. Furthermore, they are vivid proof, confirming the history of a nationality living within the Vietnamese community boasting of a rich cultural tradition.</p>\r\n<p>My Son is one of the can-not-miss attractions when you visit Central Vietnam.

I hopped out and dodged buzzing motorbikes and exhaust-belching cars, trying to get from curb to curb.</p>\r\n<p>Then I spotted it: Banh Mi Pho Hue (118 Phố Huế; 84-4-3822-5009), the no-frills sandwich shop named for the Hanoi street on which it sits. Nearly everyone I&rsquo;d asked had said Banh Mi Pho Hue served the tastiest banh mi in Hanoi. But the family that&rsquo;s run the shop since 1974 has a reputation for closing it whenever the cooks run out of ingredients. So when I arrived at 7pm on a Saturday and found it still open, I was delighted.</p>\r\n<p>Translated simply as &ldquo;wheat,&rdquo; the banh mi is a delicious and ever-varying combination of deli-style pork, pate and veggies (think carrots, cilantro, cucumber, etc), stuffed into a soft and crunchy French baguette. Regional variations in Vietnam involve adding headcheese, pork sausage and various other vegetables.</p>\r\n<p>In an age of hipster food mashups &ndash; Korean tacos, anyone? &ndash; the banh mi is the product of a true cultural and culinary blend. No food trucks, Instagram photos or tweets led to its creation. The sandwich began with colonialism &ndash; specifically, the establishment of French Indochina in 1887 &ndash; when the occupying French simply slathered butter and pate inside a baguette. Then when the Vietnamese sent the French packing in 1954, they put their own spin on the sandwich, adding slices of pork, herbs and pickled vegetables, and creating the banh mi as we know it.</p>\r\n<p>The rest of the world didn&rsquo;t learn about this spectacular sandwich until after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. As many southern Vietnamese emigrated to the United States, Europe and Australia, they brought recipes, including one for their iconic sandwich. As a result, if you&rsquo;re eating a banh mi outside of Vietnam, you&rsquo;re probably enjoying a southern-style snack: the baguettes are generally bigger and they&rsquo;re crammed with more veggies and herbs, such as cilantro, carrots and hot peppers.</p>\r\n<p>Oddly, the banh mi has always been the one kind of food I liked better outside its home turf. When I tried a banh mi in Ho Chi Minh City a few years earlier, I&rsquo;d found the bread stale and the ingredients skimpy; inside was a paltry mix of a few slices of ham, a smear of pate and flaccid cilantro and carrots. I gave up after one sandwich. I&rsquo;d had far better banh mi in New York City; even Minneapolis! Was I crazy? Could the banh mi outside of Vietnam actually be better? &nbsp;Now back in Vietnam, I was determined to find out the truth. Would my faith in the banh mi in its homeland be restored? Is the banh mi the best sandwich in the world?</p>\r\n<p>At Banh Mi Pho Hue, Geoffrey Deetz &ndash; a chef and Vietnamese food expert who&rsquo;s been living in the country for nearly 15 years &ndash; was peppering the sandwich maker with questions about ingredients. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;d just been served my banh mi, partially covered with piece of white paper affixed with a rubber band.</p>\r\n<p>I pulled back a side of the baguette to get a look at the ingredients: pork deli meat, fatty char siu pork, pork floss, creamy pate, Chinese 5 spice and, curiously, butter.&nbsp; The sandwich maker finished it off by pouring pork-chili gravy inside. Interestingly, I saw none of the herbs and veggies that spill out of the baguettes served in southern Vietnam or outside of the country.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The banh mi sandwiches in Hanoi are much more one dimensional than other parts of the country,&rdquo; Deetz told me. &ldquo;If you gave someone here the kind of over-stuffed, herb-laden sandwich you&rsquo;ve eaten in other parts of the country, they&rsquo;d probably throw up.&rdquo;</p>','Dinh Doan','2014-12-29 06:29:57','2014-12-29 06:29:57',4,'banh-my.jpg','banh-my-thumb.jpg','The world’s best sandwich?'),(11,'Cai Rang floating market','<p>This is one of the famous floating markets in Can Tho specialized in selling fruits and agricultural products of the whole region.

But the start of this flowers life is not as beautiful as one might imagine. It&rsquo;s unlike many other flowers. When the lotus first begins to sprout, it is under water, making its home in lakes and ponds in areas where the water remains fairly still on the surface. But underneath the surface, the lotus is surrounded by mud and muck and by fish, by insects, and simply dirty, rough conditions</p>\r\n<p>Despite these conditions,&nbsp;the lotus flower maintains strength, and pushes aside each of these dirty obstacles as it makes its way to clearer surfaces. At this time, the lotus is&nbsp;still just a stem with only a few leaves, and a small flower pod. But in time, the stem continues to grow, and the pod slowly surfaces above the water, into the clean air, finally freeing itself from the harsh life conditions below.</p>\r\n<p>It is then that the lotus slowly opens each beautiful petal to the sun, basking in the worldly beauty surrounding it. The lotus flower is ready to take on the world.&nbsp; Despite being born into dark, murky conditions, where hope for such beautiful life seems dubious, the lotus grows, rises above adversity. Ironically, this same dirty water washes it clean as it surfaces. As the lotus opens&nbsp;each petal to the air, not a stain or spot of mud remains externally. The inner lotus too, has never seen a drop of mud or dirty water. It is pure, and bright, and beautiful.</p>\r\n<p>In Buddhism, the bud of the lotus symbolizes potential. The lotus flower represents an awakening, spiritual growth, and enlightenment. Just as the lotus flower emerges from the water clean, the lotus also represents purity of body, speech, and mind. The lotus could be thought of as an&nbsp;<em>awakened mind,&nbsp;</em>which grows naturally toward the warmth and light of truth, love and compassion. The lotus may appear fragile on the surface, but it is flexible and strong, securely anchored under the surface of the water.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;The lotus is the most beautiful flower, whose petals open one by one.

On the surface, there is a striking series of landscapes, ranging from deeply dissected ranges and plateaux to an immense polje. There is evidence of at least one period of hydrothermal activity in the evolution of this ancient mature karst system. The plateau is probably one of the finest and most distinctive examples of a complex karst landform in SE Asia.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cultural heritage:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The oldest evidence of human occupation of the area are Neolithic axe heads and similar artefacts found in some of the caves. There are some relics of Ham Nghi King, a final King of the Nguyen dynasty before the French colonial period, at the Maria Mountain in the north of the Park. Currently the Arem, Ma Coong and Ruc ethnic groups live in two villages in the core zone of Phong Nha Ke - Bang National Park. Until 1962 these indigenous people lived in the forest in houses made of bamboo and leaves or in the caves, living from forest products and hunting. They used simple tools and their clothes were made from the bark of a toxic forest tree (Antiaris toxicaria) and lianas.</p>\r\n<p>Since 1992 the Government of Vietnam has set up two new settlements for these 475 people, who are the two smallest ethnic groups in Vietnam. These people are familiar with a number of economically valuable species, especially precious timber such as Mun and Hue (Diospyros spp., Dalbergia rimosa), and oil-extraction from species such as Tau (Hopea hainanensis) and many medicinal plants. The Phong Nha Cave has long been a site of religious and touristic importance, with an old Cham Temple discovered in the cave and it was a site of worship in the ninth and tenth centuries. During the war with the USA the Phong Nha - Ke Bang forest and caves were a garrison and weapons store for the Vietnamese army.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conservation value:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park is of high conservation value as one of the largest areas of intact forest habitat remaining in Vietnam. As part of a continuous forest block with the neighbouring Him Namno Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos it forms one of the largest areas of forest on limestone karst in Indochina. The presence of tall lowland forest, which is regionally threatened as a habitat type, in the National Park increases the area\'s conservation value.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tourist activities</strong></p>\r\n<p>The number of tourists has increased dramatically since the park was listed in UNESCO\'s World Heritage Sites. Tourism activities in the area are the responsibility of the Trading and Tourism Department of Quang Binh province, with 280 international standard rooms in the province and 8 vehicles with capacities of 4 to 15 seats for tourist transportation. The forest guards of Son Trach commune in Bo Trach district are placed on tourist security duty.</p>\r\n<p>Quang Binh Province has invested into upgrading the Phong Nha-Ke Bang visitor site to turn it into one of Vietnam\'s major tourist destinations.</p>\r\n<p>Multiple eco-tourist projects have been licensed for development and the area is being heavily developed by the province to turn it into a major tourist site in Vietnam. Phong Nha Ke Bang is part of a tourism promotion program called: \"Middle World Heritage Road\" which includes the ancient capital of Hue, the Champa relics of My Son, the city of Hoi An, nha nhac and the Space of Gong Culture in the Central Highlands of Vietnam.</p>\r\n<p>Tourist activities in Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park are organized by local travel agencies and vary in form:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Tour for expedition of caves and grottos in boats and with professional cave expedtion means.</li>\r\n<li>Ecotourism, discovering the florae and fauna in this national park in the Ke Bang Forest.</li>\r\n<li>Mountain climbing: There are extreme sloping mountains here with a height of over 1,000 m, which is a real challenge for adventurous climbers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In order to facilitate the increasing flow of tourists to the site, the Dong Hoi Airport was constructed and is due to be operational at the end of 2008.</p>\r\n<p>Phong Nha-Ke Bang, together with Ha Long Bay and Fanxipan of Vietnam, is listed as a candidate for 7 new world natural wonders vote. As of February 12, 2008 it ranked 10th in the voting list</p>\r\n<p>In summary, Phong Nha displays an impressive amount of evidence of earth&rsquo;s history. It is a site of very great importance for increasing our understanding of the geologic, geomorphic and geo-chronological history of the region.</p>','Chu Toan','2014-12-29 07:19:27','2014-12-29 11:14:59',1,'phongnha1.jpg','phong-nha-thumb.jpg','Paradise for researchers and explorers'),(16,'Tu Le','<p><strong>The village well-known for glutinous rice is the place you can enjoy the hot mineral water and contemplate peaceful landscape of populous and rich land.</strong></p>\r\n<p>On the highway 32 towards Mu Cang Chai District, Tu Le is a next-door commune of Khau Pha mountain pass, directly under Van Chan District, Yen Bai.

Yet the most interesting thing is that all those take place in most sites of the capital. &ldquo;<em>Leisuring around the rivers in the suburbs or walking down the green mountains like Soc Temple in Soc Mount, Ve Linh Mount, Phuc Tuong Mount, etc, in autumn brings in such a great feeling. Believe me, you will taste the cool and fresh air as if the most delicious desert after such a busy time</em>&rdquo;, said a busy trader during her stay in Hanoi.</p>\r\n<strong>History</strong>\r\n<p>Before being named &ldquo;Hanoi&rdquo; as present, the capital had had several names throughout history. In 1010, Ly Thai To, the first ruler of the Ly Dynasty, moved the capital of Đại Việt (the Great Viet) to the site of the Đại La Citadel. Claiming to have seen a dragon ascending the Red River, he renamed it Thăng Long (Ascending Dragon) - a name still used poetically to this day with the belief that this was good omen of the country&rsquo;s future. It remained the capital of <a href=\"http://www.vietnam-beauty.com/vietnam-overview/1-vietnam-overview/9-vietnam-overview.html\">Vietnam</a> until 1397, when the capital was moved to Thanh Hoa, also known as T&acirc;y Đ&ocirc; (Western Capital). Thăng Long then became Đ&ocirc;ng Đ&ocirc; (Eastern Capital). King Minh Mang, under the Nguyen Dynasty, has laid the name &ldquo;Hanoi&rdquo; on the capital since 1831. This means &ldquo;a city lying Between Rivers or River Interior&rdquo;, which are Red and Day rivers. Hanoi became the capital of Vietnam when North andSouth Vietnam were reunited on July 2, 1976.</p>\r\n<p>Many historians reckon that the city was established more than 1,500 years ago. Therefore, with the length of living, Hanoi is very rich of cultural, historical and traditional values.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Historical Places to visit</strong></p>\r\n<p>Within the &ldquo;River Interior City&rdquo;, there are a number of historical and beautiful places to get by. Mentioning about Hanoi, what comes first to tourists&rsquo; mind is the ever first historical University of the capital and also the nation - <a href=\"http://www.vietnam-beauty.com/cities/ha-noi/4-ha-noi/69-temple-of-literature-van-mieu-quoc-tu-giam-.html\">Van Mieu - Quoc Tu Giam</a> (Translated as &ldquo;The Literature Temple&rdquo;). Besides its foremost meaning, Van Mieu is also the place to worship Confucius, setting doctor steles. Youngsters and youth always come here to pray for success by touching the rock tortoises&rsquo; head before any examinations, cause it is believed to be very sacred.</p>\r\n<p>Since Vietnam is a Buddhism-oriented nation, its capital has been the Buddhism center for centuries. As a result, it is not surprising that there are as many as about 600 temples and pagodas in Hanoi. For Buddhist tourists, among many great pagodas, <a href=\"http://www.vietnam-beauty.com/cities/ha-noi/4-ha-noi/72-tran-quoc-pagoda-.html\">Tran Quoc Pagoda</a> should be the first to pay a visit. It is not only the oldest one among those 600, (6 century years old), but also one of the most gorgeous and sacred. The second that is worth visiting is Mot Cot Pagoda (One-Pillar pagoda), another symbol of the capital. Its special architecture is similar to a lotus on the top of water.</p>\r\n<p>Located near the two symbolic pagodas and right in the middle of the capital it is the historical Lake &ndash;<a href=\"http://www.vietnam-beauty.com/cities/ha-noi/4-ha-noi/6-ho-hoan-kiem-ho-guom-lake-of-the-restored-sword.html\"> Hoan Kiem Lake</a> (Lake of Returned Sword), and Ngoc Son Temple with 100% natural beauty. Related to the Lake, Vietnam has a classic story telling about King Le Loi after winning over Minh invader, returned the magic Sword to the Tortoise down in the Lake. Since then, the Lake was named &ldquo;Hoan Kiem&rdquo;. It is more surprising that up to now, the historical Tortoise still sometimes appear up the Lake surface for a moment.</p>\r\n<p>As for Catholics coming to Hanoi, there are also great Churches to come for praying and/or visiting. From 19th century, many Catholic churches were built in here. The biggest one is Cathedral. And Cua Bac church is a beautiful original typical French architect.</p>\r\n<p>As you may have found out, Hanoi is more an antique and peaceful city than a modern one. This might be seen quite clearly when you take a walk around the <a href=\"http://www.vietnam-beauty.com/cities/ha-noi/5-hanois-old-quarter.html\">36 Old Quarter</a>. This is a typical characteristic of Hanoi with small old streets, tube houses which still remain their shape from 19th century. Additionally, the beauty of Hanoi in the past is also found in the ancient citadel, right nearby.</p>\r\n<p>Historical places that worth to pay a visit cannot be without Ba Dinh Square, the political area where President Ho Chi Minh read the Independent Declaration on the September 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1945. As famous as this is the House of Parliament, Presidential Palace, President Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, etc.</p>\r\n<p>To know more about Vietnam in general and Hanoi in particular, both in terms of history, tourists should spend one or two days on visiting the nation&rsquo;s Ethnology, Military, History, Ho Chi Minh,... museums. These will open a huge detailed picture of this antique and beautiful historical city.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Culture</strong></p>\r\n<p>Talking about Hanoi&rsquo;s culture, there must be a long time to complete the story. The initial Hanoi&rsquo;s famous cultural thing is a series of traditional handicraft villages, such as Bat Trang ceramic and pottery village, Hang Bac silver-making street, Ngu Xa bronze-making, Phu Do noodle-making, Yen Phu incense, and Ngoc Ha flower, and Dong Ho picture villages. All of them have existed for centuries, and are still famous for 99% hand-made and 100% nature-originated products.</p>\r\n<p>Hanoians are extremely good at making and tasting food. They have so many delicacies, for example, Banh cuon (steamed rice roll), Cha ca La Vong (La Vong grilled fish), Pho (noodle) with chicken or beef, Nem (spring roll), and so on. it can be said that this is the most attractive thing for foreigners to come and feel a &ldquo;special Hanoi through Hanoi specialties&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Adding more to Hanoi\'s culture, kinds of arts play very impotant role. Hanoi&rsquo;s famous culture also lies in Folk performances, which are Water Puppet, Cheo, Tuong and A Dao&hellip; (a traditional kind of music performances).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sight-seeing</strong></p>\r\n<p>Besides plentiful cultural relics, Hanoi boasts many scenes of beauty. The most popular ones in Hanoi are peaceful lakes. Standing around all the city&rsquo;s lakes are great and high green trees with large shadows on sunny days.

It is about 700 kilometers (438 miles) south of the national capital of Hanoi and about 1100 kilometers (690 miles) north of Hochiminh City.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>History</strong></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Hue people take their pride in a long-lasting history. The city has gone through 7 centuries of establishment and development. In 1802, Hue became Vietnam&rsquo;s capital when Emperor Gia Long, the first King of the Nguyen emperors (Nguyen dynasty), chose the location for the imperial city. The city remained the nation&rsquo;s capital until 1945, when Bao Dai, the last of the Nguyen emperors, abdicated and a communist government was established in Hanoi. In the Vietnam War, Huế\'s central position placed it very near the border between North Vietnam and South Vietnam<strong>. </strong>Thanks to the long precious history, Hue has integrated material and spiritual values, which become its own unique special Culture.</p>\r\n<strong>Natural conditions</strong>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The city has 2 main seasons: dry season and rainy season. The former is fairly hot, lasting from March to August, while the latter begins from August, and is cool and wet. But the most special point is the short spring lasting from January till February, with a very cool and fresh atmosphere and green purity of new tree leaves here and there. This means if you would like to visit the city but still afraid of the hot or wet weather, please come in between January and February.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Culture</strong></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Hue is one of the main cultural, religious and educational centers of Vietnam. So far, Hue remains to be the only originally historical vestiged city in Vietnam. Many of Hue&rsquo;s attractions are found along the banks of the romantically named <a href=\"http://www.vietnam-beauty.com/cities/hue/29-hue/66-perfume-river-hng-river.html\"><strong>Perfume</strong><strong> River</strong></a> with 11km length. This valuable construction includes more than 100 architectural works, which are the reflection of the life of Emperors and mandarins under Nguyen&rsquo;s reign.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Architecture in Hue is the combination of royal architect, folk, religious ones, tradtional and modern sides. On December 11th, 1993, it was classified by UNESCO as the world cultural heritage. On the north bank of the river is the <a href=\"http://www.vietnam-beauty.com/cities/hue/29-hue/87-the-citadel-of-hue-city.html\"><strong>Imperial Citadel</strong></a>, built along the line of Peking&rsquo;s Forbidden City, enclosed by 10-metre thick walls and surrounded by a moat. A few kilometers further up the river are perhaps Hue&rsquo;s best-known religious site. Inside the citadel, there are still wonders. For example, the seat of the Nguyen emperors occupying a large, walled area on the north side of the river. Inside the citadel was a forbidden city where only the concubines, emperors, and those close enough to them were granted access, the punishment for trespassing was death penalty.</p>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">If you like something mysterious and valuably architectural, you should take a visit to the tombs of ancient Kings. Situated in the middle of the hills on the Southern bank of Perfume River are very beautiful tombs of Nguyen Kings. Among these tombs are the four famous ones with the name and the arrangements of the tomb reflecting each Emperor&rsquo;s points of view, personality, and tastes. This is majestic Gia Long tomb, imposing Minh Mang tomb, poetic Tu Duc tomb and magnificent Khai Dinh tomb. No architects who would like to discover ancient architecture of Vietnam could ignore Hue&rsquo;s old citadel vestiges.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Royal Music</strong></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">A lot of foreign tourists are curious about Hue&rsquo;s ritual royal music. Originated from 8 kinds of ritual music under Le dynasty, under Nguyen dynasty, it has improved into 2 kinds of music: &ldquo;Dai nhac&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nha nhac&rdquo;, which are really magnificent, and skillful. Those are only played on formal occasions. This city is proud to be the cadral of traditional music. The Royal Refined Music was proclaimed by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on December 1993.</p>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><strong>Religion</strong></div>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Hue is also an important center of Buddhism. In Hue and the surroundings still exists tens of pagodas constructed more than 300 years ago, and a hundred of temples and pagodas built in the early century. <a href=\"http://www.vietnam-beauty.com/cities/hue/29-hue/75-thien-mu-pagoda-heaven-fairy-lady-pagoda.html\"><strong>Thien Mu Pagoda</strong></a>, with its distinctive seven-storey octagonal tower.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Besides all these, Hue&rsquo;s culture is also found in its famous &ldquo;non la&rdquo; or conical hats. You can buy these at the enormous <strong><a href=\"http://www.vietnam-beauty.com/cities/hue/29-hue/70-dong-ba-market-one-of-the-romantic-hues-symbols.html\">Dong Ba Market</a> </strong>as a remarkable and graceful piece of souvenir of Vietnam.

He fell in love with her at first sight, and they are now a very happy couple &ndash; husband and wife!! Vietnamese cultural grace could win any heart.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Festival and Cuisine</strong></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Festivals are also attractions of Hue. There are two main kinds of festival here. Royal festival reflects the life and ritual activities of Nguyen dynasty, almost paying more attention to the ritual than the ceremony.

Several all-vegetarian restaurants are scattered in various corners of the city to serve the locals who have a strong tradition of eating vegetarian twice a month, as part of their Buddhist beliefs.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">No one who has come to Hue could ignore its ancient beauty and romance.
